* Overview

ol-straight implements the org links[fn:1] API for the straight[fn:2] package manager.  Create an autocompleted =straight= -type link with =org-insert-link=[fn:3], and =org-open-at-point=[fn:4] will take you straight to the package's home page.  Exporting the org file will insert the referenced package's homepage URL straight in to the exported document.

* Installing

Clone the repository, add =ol-straight.el= to your load path, and require it.  Or use straight:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(ol-straight :host github :repo "rkallio/ol-straight"))

(with-eval-after-load 'ol
  (require 'ol-straight))
#+end_src
