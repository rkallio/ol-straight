* Overview

ol-straight implements the org links[fn:1] API for the straight package manager.  Create an autocompleted =straight= link with =org-insert-link=[fn:2], and =org-open-at-point=[fn:3] will take you straight to the package's home page.  Exporting the org file will insert the package's homepage in to the exported document.

* Installing

Clone the repository, add =ol-straight.el= to your load path, and require it.
